## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation for a research project on **multi-class brain tumor classification** using **ConvNeXt** architecture with **transfer learning** and **fine-tuning techniques**. The study focuses on classifying MRI brain scans into three tumor types: **glioma**, **meningioma**, and **pituitary tumor**, as well as the **normal** class.

By leveraging pre-trained ConvNeXt models (Tiny, Small, Base, and Large), we demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in enhancing classification performance on medical imaging tasks, even with limited annotated data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be downloaded from the following Figshare link:

ðŸ”— [Brain Tumor Dataset on Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427)

The dataset contains T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI images categorized into:

- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma Tumor
- Pituitary Tumor

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Fine-tuning of multiple ConvNeXt variants
- Transfer learning applied to a medical imaging domain
- Data preprocessing and augmentation pipeline
- Multi-class classification of brain tumor types
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and sensitivity

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- NumPy
